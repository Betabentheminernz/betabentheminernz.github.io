            <h1>Hey there! I am Bentheminernz and I'm a beginner/intermediate coder.</h1>
            <h3>As you may've seen before on the main screen I am learning HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also know a bit of Python.</h3>
            <p>Recently I created this GitHub Page to share my findings and my progress with others and to keep track of what I've learnt and my progress I've made. I've been learning about Coding for at least 5~ years now. I started on Scratch at first but then I learnt some extremely basic python and now I'm learning Web Development. One day I hope to land a job somewhere in coding development but for now I'm tinkering with what I know and sharing my knowledge with others. I've also taken part in a couple of coding challenges like First Lego League I did that twice and came 2nd first year and 1st the second. I also did the scratch challenge (a local challenge in my area) I came 3rd in that. I'm always looking to expand my knowledge and try new things with coding.</p>
