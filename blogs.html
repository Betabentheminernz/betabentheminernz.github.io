            <h3><b>23/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>Currently figuring out how to properly set up this GitHub pages website. Need to figure out good way to show these logs. Also need to figure out how to include p5.js scripts and games as I am learning to how make those. Also need to figure out how to fix GitHub pages not updating after pushing new website commit update (Most likely a GitHub thing but will look into it.)</p>
            <h3><b>24/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>Managed to rehost this website on GitHub Desktop so it's easier push updates without using Command Line. Managed to create seperate pages on this website so these logs and the about is seperated. Also learnt how to link different HTML pages. Need to still figure out the page not updating correctly. Also need to figure out how to put p5.js games onto this website and fix them as they do not work correctly when I put the code into the p5.js website.</p>
            <h3><b>26/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>Sorry for not posting a log yesterday I was extremely busy fixing and adding stuff to this website. Now back to the log. Managed to add Games to this website, games are Spaceship Flappy Bird and Escape the Alien. Supposed to have another game like the chrome dino game but it's astronaut theme but it would not work when I added it to the site. Also had another Weekly coding lesson and learnt more stuff, working on a new game and learning some very important keycodes and movement code for p5.js games. Need to still fix the website not updating correctly problem, still can't find a answer annoyingly. Also adding those games took wayyy to long, wish I followed a tutorial instead of trying to go in blind thinking I can do it, which I managed to do but anyway will maybe take a break for a day or probably 1 hour LOL, from working on this site. </p>
            <h3><b>27/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>Surprise update! Managed to move the website to bentheminernz.github.io instead of bentheminernz.github.io/codingwebsite, which is much easier to remember isn't it! That's more a less it for today, was a major pain to fix images and links due to changing the repository name. Also need to still figure out the website not updating correctly :( and need to fix the Astronaut game. I'm also happy to announce that the website is now in beta! I am starting to become happy with it and a full release should be a week or two at most!</p>
            <h3><b>30/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>Starting to be happy with this website and it's getting closer to a full release but I have thought of a big project which would take a while but I think it would be great. I'm thinking of adding a Unblocked Games section with Games like 1v1.lol or games from CoolMathsGames. I'd think it'd be really good and could be successful but thats just a thought. I will look into it though but it will take a long time so might make a beta channel of this website or I keep the website in beta for longer will have to figure it out but I think it could be really cool.</p>
            <h3><b>31/03/22</b></h3>
            <p>So I started on the Unblocked Games section and surprisingly it isn't actually hard to make it so actually it won't take as long as I predicted it'd take. I already have 5 games on there and I have included a Google Forum if you'd like to request a game to be added. So the proper release shouldn't be to far off hopefully! I also may change the Bentheminernz website name, I will add a big hard to not notice image on the front page so you know what the URL will be when I change it. Other than that I think that is it pretty happy with the unblocked games section and I will add more to it in the days to come.</p>
            <h3><b>3/04/22</b></h3>
            <p>Sorry for lack of blogs but anyway I have added a new projects where I have added a paint app so far, need to figure out how to add a hide or show button for those shapes as well. Also added a new game that I made, it is two player snake and works just like your normal average snake. Might also try see about getting a proper domain for this website instead of a .github.io so maybe a .com or .co.nz I'm not sure. Also I might as well plug it while I'm here but if you want to suggest a game there is a google form in the unblocked games section (Main Page -> Games -> Unblocked Games)</p>
            <h3><b>16/05/22</b></h3>
            <p>Yikes it been a long time since I've made a log..... sorry? Since then I decided to quit my coding courses and instead opt in for free better coding courses via Linkedin Learning. I found out that p5.js was to put it nicely not super good or useful... so now I'm doing linkedin learning courses and I found out there are so many simple things in HTML that was just never covered. I definetly feel like I'm going to learn a lot more now but only time can tell.</p>
            <h3><b>11/08/22</b></h3>
            <p>Been doing some stuff behind the scenes. Making stuff a little more stable and added a new spot the monster game thing. Mainly been continuing with Linkedin Learning though. Completed the HTML course and now I'm going to start doing CSS. Afterwards I'm probably gonna do JS, Python and look into Bootstrap and Django. With django websites can be for more powerful but I can no longer host it on github pages... meaning I'd have to create my own server (which I can definetly do although its annoying) and I'd also most likely have to start paying for a website domain which costs a lot... I do plan on doing that though anyway. Sorry for the lack of updates, I just can't really think of stuff to add, I will most likely move this to the full website soon though as I feel like this is stable and good enough for my likings, after doing that I will shutdown this beta github page for a while until I want to test something else though.</p>
            <h3><b>20/08/22</b></h3>
            <p>Have been tinkering with the Nav Bar a lot and I think I'm finally happy with it. I'm using a navbar from <a style="color: blue;" href="https://getbootstrap.com"><u>bootstrap</u></a> and with a little bit of my own tinkering with it I've customized it to to how I like it. I am trying to figure out how to add a right side dropdown into a regular dropdown so I can add the other project stuff directly into the nav bar. Still have no idea what I am going to put on the home page I need to think of something! I just can't think of what to do! I know I keep saying this but I'll definetly update the main page soonish, I'll do it after I sorted out the homepage.</p>
